## Deployed this project on https://our-metro.herokuapp.com/

This web application is designed for efficient management of metro card holders and users of metro services. It provides the following features:

User Accounts: Users can log in or register to access and manage their metro card accounts, including checking and updating their balance.
Ticket Booking: Allows users to book tickets for metro journeys directly from the website.
Non-Card Users: Provides an option for users who do not have a metro card to purchase single-journey tickets between stations.
The system streamlines the process for both cardholders and occasional passengers, enhancing the overall user experience for metro services.
